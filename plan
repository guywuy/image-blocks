# Final goal -
Able to accept an image, and replace it with an array of smaller images, that give a similar overall picture.

Resize the image e.g. to 600px x 400px.
Split into small blocks (e.g. 30px x 20px).
For each block, determine the average colour.
For each block, determine which image from a preexisting bank of images has the perceptually closest average colour.
Return an array of filenames, to place images.

Check whether bitwise operators would be useful.


Next step, 
 enable any file to be source - via upload or otherwise. Simple express server with file upload, and receive organised array of image thumbnails when it's processed (resized and analysed).
