# Final goal -
Able to accept an image, and replace it with an array of smaller images, that give a similar overall picture.

Resize the image e.g. to 600px x 400px.
Split into small blocks (e.g. 30px x 20px).
For each block, determine the average colour.
For each block, determine which image from a preexisting bank of images has the closest average colour.
Return an array of filenames, to place images.


First test - able to determine average colour of a block? Of a picture?

Sum the r, g, b values for each pixel and divide each by number of pixels scanned to find the average. Check p5/processing work to check whether bitwise operators would be useful.


Second - with test picture, split into blocks and get average colour of each block. Store result in array/object.
Use object to lay out blocks of pure average colour.

Next step, create bank of reference images, create small versions (30px x 20px) and store their filename and colour in an object for reference.
Work out how to match (binary search on ordered colour values possible?) Colour values in format RGB - compare each channel?
