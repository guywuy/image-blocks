# Image as thumbnails - processing image on clientside -
Able to accept an image, and replace it with an array of smaller images, that give a similar overall picture.

- User uploads image, which is sent to web worker.
- Web worker resizes the image to 600px x 400px, splits the image into 30x20px blocks and returns an array containing the average colour of each block.
- The main thread receives the array of colours, and matches each to a thumbnail which has the most similar colour.
- The thumbnails are displayed as a grid, as well as a grid of the original block colours.
- n.b - Thumbnails and their colour data are necessary and are hosted statically. They can be generated by putting source images in `/img/srcImages` directory and running `node processSourceImages`. The thumbnail file data can then be included in the index.html (or fetched).

## Client side or server side?

### Decided to try much of this Client side - 
Image upload data passed to web worker, returned in form of array of 400 rgb values, matched to thumbnails to display.
Better than having to process image on server.
Uses browserfied fork of JIMP - https://github.com/strandedcity/jimp


## To do: 
- Add ability to work with different block sizes. (Used in for loop in worker, and in grid template layout)
- Final image display should have each image link to source image for viewing high res version
- Move thumbnail matching computation to web worker?
